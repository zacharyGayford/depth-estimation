## Documentation
This project was created from [this](https://medium.com/artificialis/getting-started-with-depth-estimation-using-midas-and-python-d0119bfe1159) resource and served as an introductory resource into depth estimation. This script uses a pretrained depth estimation model named [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS). The dependnacies are managed by [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/).
